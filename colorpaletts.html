    <h1>Queens Food Truck</h1>
    <li><img src="images/foodtruck.jpg" alt="Food Truck" height="100px"></li>
    <p>I pick the first and second squares as my dominant colors. The two dominant colors<br> for my logo because the white represents cleanliness and it stands out with the green.<br> I like the green because it represents nature and a good Mexican food truck uses good<br> fresh ingredients like avocados, limes, and cilantro, so it appeals to people's palettes.<br> The oranges i choose for my background because the Orange represents warmth and it<br> represents creativity and uniqueness. The background will be used to keep people<br> in the page and interact with the menu.</p>

    <h1>A Kids' Cartoon</h1>
    <li><img src="images/kidscartoon.jpg" alt="Kid Cartoon" height="100px"></li>
    <p>My Primary colors for this website are the teal and lime green because it would make<br> a good mix for a logo. The Teal color is said to encourage objective and analytical thinking<br> which is good for a kids' website, while the lime green is a symbol of energy. And the Brown<br> would be the background page while the cotent would be the yellow color with orange.<br> The yellow represents positivity while the orange represents joy. I picked these colors because<br> they are bright colors in a dark background that will have a nice solid look to the page that gets<br> kids wanting to visit it. Also the theme colors i was thinking Adventure cartoon.</p>

    <h1>A Social Justice Non-profit Organization</h1>
    <li><img src="images/socialjustice.jpg" alt="Social Justice" height="100px"></li>
    <p>The dark green and tan are my primary colors for my logo the green for the background<br> and the tan for my actual logo. I picked those color's based on website information that<br> ive seen.The dark green I picked because green is part of the Mexican flag and on the flag<br> it stands as a symbol of hope. Making it dark green it symbolizes the Dominance of hope<br> that illegal immigrants should sustain. The Beige is used to give people a relaxing, calming<br> feel when searching for information. And the brown signifys reliability and that would be for<br>information in this case.</p>

    <h1>A Local News Blog</h1>
    <li><img src="images/newsblog.jpg" alt="New Blog" height="100px"></li>
    <p>The primary colors i picked for the logo is red and grey. The red is a dominant color that<br> would pair well with gray. The gray represents formality which is good for a news blog<br> webpage. The silver color makes the web page industrial and modern. The content would<br> be made up of the darker colored red with black because the black also represent's dominance.<br> A news blog should hold an image of power, because it would make the website more likely<br> to be viewed because the colors give out an elegant image that people will like visiting.</p>

    <h1>Fishing Video Game App</h1>
    <li><img src="images/fishinggame.jpg" alt="Fishing Game Colors" height="100px"></li>
    <p>My dominant colors are baby blue and orange for my logo. the baby blue color stand for<br> depth and stability which is good for the game idea. The orange is to make the game<br> more welcoming which is why its part of the logo. The paler blue i picked for the background<br> and the teal for the actual in game water. The blue colors mostly represent calmness which is<br> a feeling that a fishing game should have. Thatswhy the content is going to be made up of the<br> lighter blue colors. The teal i want to it to be the actual base of the webpages and the content<br> be made up of the lighter colors and the grey to make it look more professional.</p>
