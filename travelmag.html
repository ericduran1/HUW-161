  <p>The reason I picked the steel sky blue color is because when I think "travel"<br> I think of planes in the sky and its a nice welcoming color. The dark blue I<br> picked because it reminds me of the oceon but also could be used for the<br> color of the links and make them more visible. The teal color also gave me<br> the feel of clear teal water that would be featured in a travel magazine along<br> side the gold yellow color for beautiful sand. I think the colors all have a nice<br> blend. I picked those two Fonts Roboto and Domine because the Roboto i can<br> see you writing a country name clearly and big and the Domine Font looks<br> like text from travel magazines that ive seen.</p>
